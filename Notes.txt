-> HTML - Hypertext Markup Language

- Used to structure content on a web page (images, text, forms etc)
- We structure content using HTML tags

Some have both opening and closing tags like "<p></p>" and some have only opening tags <img>

-> CSS - Cascading Style Sheets

- works alongside HTML
- Used to style web pages to make them look better
 - Change colours, position, effects, font sizes etc


 - index.html is the kind of like the default home page, when you run your website on the browser it looks for this file
